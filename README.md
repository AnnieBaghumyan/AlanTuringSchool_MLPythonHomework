ML Python

Classification Task.
You have ‘f_data_sm.rda’.
Task 1-3 for one LEAGUE, choose yourselves.
Task 4-12 for all data.
0. Create a GitHub repository for this project. And all tasks need to
push there.
1. Calculate an average number of goals for home and away teams per
SEASON for that league and sort them in descending order.
Which clubs are more consistent?
2. Construct a plot to show how this number is changing over time.
Hint:
SEASON on the x-axis. Show average Home goals and Away goals on the same
plot. Be sure that your plot has appropriate axis names and tittle.
3. Find the following clubs for each season:
- the best attack (top 5)
- the best defense (top5)
4. Add a column where will be displayed the goal difference. For example,
if the FTSC column contains 1:3, then in our new column we need to put 2.
5. After that delete FTSC, FTHG, and FTAG Columns.
6. FTR column will be our label and we need to predict it.
7. Data Processing - Clean Data
8. Data Encoding
9. Modelling
10. Showing how you choose model hyperparameters.
Hint: GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV.
11. Showing results and presenting the best models.
Hint:
a) For more convenient work, I advise you to complete tasks with the help
of the Jupyter Notebook
b) Try to use different tools to process the data before transferring its
model.
c) Don't forget to write in your repository README.md.
